(comment

  ;; --- Live Code Reloading --- 

  ;; (.start (Thread. (fn []))) instead of  (future & body)
  ;; for example, call the following within cider
  ;; to be able to play with live reloading
  (.start (Thread. (fn [] (alpha-live-reload/main))))
  ;; and try redefining the hot-draw atom within that namespace in your repl

  ;; For OSX: lwjgl must be called from the main thread, so
  ;; start this project with 'lein run alpha-live-reload cider' and connect
  ;; to the repl in cider with M-x cider-connect.
